Sync phone folders to folders on a NAS share

Supported share types:
â€¢ SMB

Runs as a foreground service that syncs folders every 24 hours or can be manually synced in app by hitting the refresh button

This was mainly created as a solution for my use case so beware if using for yourself there may be things that need adapting :)
